<!-- **Problem 1** -->

<!-- Ryan borrowed $\$2300$ in year 1 and an additional $\$1600$ in year 2 for total of $\$3900$. The 1-year spot rate is $3\%$ and the two-year spot rate is $4\%$. Under the loan, the interest rate resets annually to the 1-year spot rate. Ryan entered into a 2-year interest rate swap to pay the fixed interest rate and receive the variable rate.
