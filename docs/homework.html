<!-- Ignoring the interest on the premium, calculate the customer's profit if the index declines to $45$ at expiration. -->
<!-- **Problem 2** -->
<!-- A four-month European call option with a strike price of $60$ is selling for $5$. -->
<!-- The price of the underlying stock is $61$, and the annual continuously compounded risk-free rate is $12\%$.  -->

<!-- **Problem 3** -->
<!-- A nondividend paying stock has price $30$. You are given: -->
<!-- i) The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is $5\%$. -->
<!-- ii) A $6$-month European call option on the stock costs $3.10$. -->
<!-- iii) A $6$-month European put option on the stock with the same strike price as the call option cost $5.00$. -->
<!-- Determine the strike price. -->
<!-- **Problem 4** -->
<!-- Prices for a stock are modeled with a $1$-period binomial tree with u=$1.2$, d=$0.7$, and a period of $3$ months. A European call option on the stock expires in $3$ months. -->
<!-- You are given: -->
<!-- (i)The stock's initial price is $50$. -->
<!-- (ii)The stock pays no dividends. -->
<!-- (iii)The strike price for the call option is $55$. -->
<!-- (iv)The price of the call option is $3.10$. -->
<!-- Determine the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate. -->

<!-- #### Week 15{-#w15} -->
<!-- **Problem 1** -->
<!-- Ryan borrowed $\$2300$ in year 1 and an additional $\$1600$ in year 2 for total of $\$3900$. The 1-year spot rate is $3\%$ and the two-year spot rate is $4\%$. Under the loan, the interest rate resets annually to the 1-year spot rate. Ryan entered into a 2-year interest rate swap to pay the fixed interest rate and receive the variable rate. The notional amount of the swap matches the notional amount of the loan. Determine the level swap rate $R$. -->

<!-- Sue borrowed $\$20,000$ for $2$ years at a variable interest rate. She will make an interest payment to the lender at the end of each year and repays the loan of $\$20,000$ at the end of $2$ years. The 1-year spot rate is $3.5\%$ and the 2-year spot rate is $4\%$. Sue decided to enter into a 2-year interest rate swap under which she will swap the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate with annual settlement periods and a notional amount of $\$20,000$. The variable rate is the 1-year spot interest rate at the beginning of the settlement period. Determine the net swap payment at the end of the second year and state whether she will be paying or receiving this payment. -->
<!-- **Problem 3** -->
<!-- William has a $25,000$ loan from AIN Bank. Under the terms of the loan, William will pay interest annually to AIN Bank based on LIBOR plus $75$ basis points and will pay the principal of $25,000$ at the end of $10$ years. William enters into a 10-year interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25,000$ and annual settlement dates. He will pay a fixed rate of $3.35\%$ and will receive a variable rate of LIBOR plus $65$ basis points.

Bert purchases a $20$-year par value bond identical to the one purchased by Matt except it is not callable. Assuming a nominal semiannual yield of $6\%$, the cost of the bond purchased by Bert is $P$. Calculate $P$. -->
